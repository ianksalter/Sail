## A First Voyage ##

So you are about to go on your first voyage on a sail boat. You arrive at the marina 
and the captain takes you to the boat. The first thing that will happen is a safety 
briefing.

### The Safety Briefing ###

Fire etc.

Oh probably talk about life jackets too.

The web has an edit too.

### Figure of Eight Knot ###

At some point the skipper notices that the jib sheet doesn't have a stopper knot. This 
means that it could fly through the clutches he teaches you to tie a figure of eight 
knot.
