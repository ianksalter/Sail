## Preface to the English edition ##

Around Christmas of 2017 I was at a party somewhere in North London. We were talking about how much we had listened to our parents when someone piped up with:

    "If I'd listened to my parents I would be retired and living on a yacht by now". 

As the Christmas period drew to a close and I made my way back to Lisbon where I live on my sail boat freed from wage slavery, this comment stayed with me. It conjures up a commonly held view that sailing and living on a boat are expensive activities. I don't believe this to be the case, in fact exactly the oposite has proved to be the case for me and many others that I know.

However I had to admit that if you had suggested 15 years ago that I would one day live on a boat that I had sailed from the UK to Portugal, I would have thought you were mad, precisely because I held that exact view that sail boats were a passion of the very rich. I learned otherewise thanks to the kindness of my friend Debbie, who invited me onto her boat and, literrally, showed me the ropes and taught me a great deal else in the bargin.

In January of 2018 my Belgium friend St√©phane and I were chatting idly. We sat on a boat, probably his, beers in hand, talking about why we liked spending time on the water. One of the things we both realised is that one of the most fun things for us was introducing others to sailing. It is something special to watch the wonder in someones eyes when as they helm for the first time and feel the power of the wind moving them throught the water and that's without leaving Lisbon's harbour. On that day we decided we'd like to spend more of our lives getting others into sailing.

Of course one way of getting into sailing is through the excelent Royal Yachting Association (RYA) courses. To get you to the International Certificate for Operators of Pleasure Craft (the maritime equivalent of a basic driving license) would involve the following:

* Level 1 Start Sailing (Practical)
* Level 2 Basic Skills (Practical)
* Start Yachting (Practical)
* Essential Navigation & Seamanship (Classroom)
* Competent Crew (Practical)
* Day Skipper (Practical)
