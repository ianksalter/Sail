## Preface to the English edition ##

Around Christmas of 2017 I was at a party somewhere in North London. We were talking about how much we had listened to our parents when someone piped up with:

    "If I'd listened to my parents I would be retired and living on a yacht by now". 

As the Christmas period drew to a close and I made my way back to Lisbon where I live on my sail boat freed from wage slavery, this comment stayed with me. It conjures up a commonly held view that sailing and living on a boat are expensive activities. I don't believe this to be the case, in fact exactly the oposite has proved to be the case for me and many others that I know.

However I had to admit that if you had suggested 15 years ago that I would one day live on a boat that I had sailed from the UK to Portugal, I would have thought you were mad, precisely because I held that exact view that sail boats were a passion of the very rich. I learned otherewise thanks to the kindness of another, who invited me onto their boat and showed me the ropes and taught me a great deal else in the process.

In January of 2018 my Belgium friend St√©phane were chatting idly. We set on a boat, probably his, beers in hand talking about why we liked spending time on the water. ....
